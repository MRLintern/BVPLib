## BVPLib
---
* A `C++20` developed Library for solving ___Boundary Value Problems___.

### Update
* __Modules__ (`.ixx`) have been added to the `include` directory.

### Introduction
---
* This is a `.so` (__shared object__) file which can be used to solve __Boundary Value Problems__.
* This library will make use of `C++20` features, such as `modules` instead of `header files`, amoung other features found in older `C++` versions.

### Theory of BVPs
---
* TODO.

### Requirements
---
* __Compiler__: `GCC 10` introduced the first significant, though still experimental, support for `C++20` features. However, the version I've used is `gcc/g++ 15.1.0`.
* __OS__: `Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)`.
* __Eigen__: For the Linear Algebra.
* `CMake`.
* __Text Editor/IDE__: whatever you fancy.

### Running and Using the Software
---
* TODO.
